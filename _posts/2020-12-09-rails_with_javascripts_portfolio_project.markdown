**ABOUT MY PROJECT**

My previous projects revolved around a tour guide for Ghana, as this is something I would want to make a reality. For this project I decided to build upon the tour guide in my rails  project using Javascript to add dynamic features and expand the concept based on the requirement of this project. The title of this project is The Year Of Return, It is a tour guide that displays top 10 popular sites in Ghana with descriptions and functions that makes it user interactive.

I made thumbnail sketches of how I wanted the outcome, printed the project requirements and kept it handy. I used a simple set up guide from https://github.com/learn-co-students/js-spa-project-instructions-online-web-sp-000/blob/master/setup-walkthrough.md which gave a walkthrough on setting up the entire project.  I watched the videos by Cernan Bernardo [https://instruction.learn.co/student/video_lectures#/311](http://) which was concise and made it super easy to follow. I got inspiration from instructor Michael Doherty's videos on Youtube as well. 

After setting up the project, I set my controller actions and rendered the data as JSON in the browser. I used  AJAX and JAVASCRIPT to make fetch request to the backend containing the data and returned the response by appending the response to the DOM. AJAX ( Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique that retrieves data from a web page and displays it without refreshing the entire page.

I enjoyed using Javascript as a frontend for this project, as a graphic designer I am glad to know the actions that work behind the scenes to make the user friendly displays we see everyday.
