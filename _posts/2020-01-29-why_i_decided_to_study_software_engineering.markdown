I was in the 6th grade when I first saw and held a computer. It was in a newly opened computer lab with limited number of desktop computers where two students had to work on one computer. As part of our school's curruculum, I had my computer lessons once a week for 30 minutes. Those moments felt like heaven to me since that was the only time I got to touch a computer.  

With a deep passion for computers, I started designing and creating artwork in High School using the word art computer program. I furthered my education at the University of Science of Technology where I studied Graphic Design.
 
With my love for creativity and design, I want to be a Software Engineer so I can equip myself with the skills needed to build quality software to benefit the world as a whole.
