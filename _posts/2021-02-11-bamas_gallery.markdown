React & Redux project is â€œMy Last Portfolio Project" at Flatiron School .  A lot of time was used planning the entire project since that is the building block of a successful outcome. I narrowed my ideas down to building an Art Gallery App that allows an artist to keep track of his artworks. An artist can create style(s) they used and add different pieces to their style(s) using the web form. Users can also click on individual styles to see more details about the artwork. An artist can also delete pieces they no longer want to keep track of.

Two separate applications were created for the Backend and the Frontend app.  The Backend (API) was developed using Ruby on Rails. React and Redux Frontend was also built to send requests to the API to load data. 

The Frontend Actions were created. Actions are plain JavaScript objects that have a type field that describe what happens in the application. The action objects were dispatched to the reducer; (Reducers are functions that take the current state and an action as arguments and return a new state). It changes the state based on the action that was sent. The design aspect of the project was handled using bootstrap and the effect was amazing. This was another interesting part of the project.

The most difficult part of the project was trying to understand how everything connected in the Redux store. A very difficult moment was trying to add an image upload functionality. In order to overcome this difficulty, I dedicated time to watching videos and reading extensively. I got a lot of ideas and solutions which helped me overcome the difficulty. I would like to add more advanced functionalities to my project to broaden my knowledge and skillset.
